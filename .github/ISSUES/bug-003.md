# Bug Report #003

**Title**: Task filter state is lost on page refresh

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Fixed

**Reported By**: QA Team  
**Date**: 2024  
**Fixed Date**: 2024

## Description
When a user applies filters (status or priority) to the task list and then refreshes the page, the filter selections are reset to default. Users need to reapply filters after each page refresh.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Select a filter (e.g., "Completed" from status filter)
4. Verify tasks are filtered correctly
5. Refresh the page (F5 or browser refresh)
6. Observe that filters are reset to "All Statuses" / "All Priorities"

## Expected Behavior
- Filter selections should persist after page refresh
- User's filter preferences should be saved
- Filters should be restored when page loads

## Actual Behavior
- Filters reset to default values on page refresh
- User must reapply filters manually
- No persistence mechanism

## Environment
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Browser**: All browsers
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Inconvenient - users lose their filter settings
- **Usability**: Minor annoyance, especially for users who frequently filter
- **Workaround**: Reapply filters after each refresh

## Root Cause
Filter state is stored only in React component state, not persisted to localStorage.

## Solution Implemented
1. Save filter state to localStorage on change
2. Restore filter state from localStorage on component mount
3. Apply restored filters automatically

```javascript
// Save to localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('taskFilters', JSON.stringify(filter));
}, [filter]);

// Restore from localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  const savedFilters = localStorage.getItem('taskFilters');
  if (savedFilters) {
    setFilter(JSON.parse(savedFilters));
  }
}, []);
```

## Verification
✅ Filters persist after page refresh
✅ Filters are restored correctly on page load
✅ Works for both status and priority filters
✅ Tested across multiple browsers
