**Title**: Minor UI alignment issue in task cards on mobile devices

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Open (Deferred to v1.1.0)

**Reported By**: QA Team  
**Date**: 2024

## Description
On mobile devices (screen width < 768px), the action buttons (Edit, Delete) in task cards are slightly misaligned. The buttons appear cramped and may overlap with other elements on very small screens.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the application on a mobile device or resize browser to mobile width (< 768px)
2. Log in to the application
3. Navigate to dashboard
4. View task cards
5. Observe button alignment in task card footer

## Expected Behavior
- Buttons should be properly aligned
- Buttons should have adequate spacing
- Layout should be responsive and clean on all screen sizes

## Actual Behavior
- Edit and Delete buttons appear slightly misaligned
- Buttons may appear cramped on very small screens
- Spacing between elements is not optimal

## Environment
- **OS**: All mobile operating systems
- **Browser**: Mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)
- **Screen Size**: < 768px width
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Screenshots
_Mobile view showing button alignment issues_

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Minor visual issue, does not affect functionality
- **Usability**: Buttons are still clickable and functional
- **Workaround**: None needed - cosmetic issue only

## Proposed Solution
1. Adjust CSS for mobile breakpoints
2. Improve button spacing and alignment
3. Consider stacking buttons vertically on very small screens
4. Add media queries for better mobile responsiveness

## Priority
**Low** - Cosmetic issue, does not block functionality. Can be addressed in future release.
