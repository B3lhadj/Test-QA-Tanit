**Severity**: High

**Status**: Open (Deferred to v1.1.0)

**Reported By**: QA Team  
**Date**: 2024

## Description
When a user clicks the "Delete" button on a task card, the task is immediately deleted without any confirmation. This can lead to accidental deletion of important tasks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Create a task or locate an existing task
4. Click the "Delete" button on any task card
5. Observe that the task is deleted immediately

## Expected Behavior
- A confirmation dialog should appear asking "Are you sure you want to delete this task?"
- User should be able to confirm or cancel the deletion
- Task should only be deleted after confirmation

## Actual Behavior
- Task is deleted immediately upon clicking the delete button
- No confirmation dialog appears
- No way to undo the deletion

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10, macOS, Linux
- **Browser**: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Screen Resolution**: All

## Screenshots
_No screenshots available - behavior is consistent across environments_

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users may accidentally delete important tasks
- **Data Loss**: Potential loss of user data
- **Workaround**: None available

## Proposed Solution
1. Add a confirmation modal/dialog before deletion
2. Include task title in confirmation message
3. Provide "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons
4. Only proceed with deletion after user confirmation

## Priority
**High** - Should be fixed in next release (v1.1.0)

## Related Issues
None
