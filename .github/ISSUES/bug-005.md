**Title**: Console warning for unused variable in development mode

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Open (Deferred to v1.1.0)

**Reported By**: QA Team  
**Date**: 2024

---

## Description
In development mode, there is a console warning about an unused variable. This does not affect production but creates noise in the development console.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the development server
2. Open browser developer console (F12)
3. Navigate through the application
4. Observe console warnings

## Expected Behavior
- No console warnings in development mode
- Clean console output
- All variables are properly used

## Actual Behavior
- Console shows warning: "Unused variable: [variable name]"
- Warning appears in development mode only
- Does not affect functionality

## Environment
- **OS**: All operating systems
- **Browser**: All browsers (development mode)
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Mode**: Development only

## Impact
- **Development Experience**: Minor annoyance for developers
- **Production**: No impact (warning only in development)
- **Functionality**: No impact

## Root Cause
Unused variable or import in one of the React components.

## Proposed Solution
1. Remove unused variable/import
2. Or use the variable if it's needed
3. Add ESLint rule to catch unused variables

## Priority
**Low** - Development-only issue, no user impact. Can be addressed during code cleanup.

## Related Issues
None
